# Microprocessor
A microprocessor is an integrated circuit (IC) which incorporates core functions of a computerâ€™s central processing unit (CPU).
It is a programmable multipurpose silicon chip, clock driven, register based, accepts binary data as input and provides output after processing it as per the instructions stored in the memory.
A processor is the brain of a computer which basically consists of Arithmetical and Logical Unit (ALU), Control Unit and Register Array.
So basically a microprocessor takes input from input devices, process it as per instructions given in the memory and produces output.
